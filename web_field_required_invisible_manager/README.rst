This module allows to set a field required, invisible or readonly for users belonging to a specific group.

The field can be required, invisible or readonly in any case, or according to specific conditions.

**Table of contents**

Usage
=====

Go to Settings > Technical > Models

Select a model > in tab "Custom required fields", "Custom invisible fields" or "Custom readonly fields" add a line

Select a field, add one or more group and enable flag "Required", "Invisible" or "Readonly"

If needed, set a condition for which the field should be required, invisible or readonly for users of those groups.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

When one model inherits another (e.g. res.users inherits res.partner) and new custom
field is created, then same field is created for inheriting model as well, which should
be avoided or at least duplicated field should be also manual, but created as base.
