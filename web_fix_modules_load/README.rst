Odoo loads translations and module info using their names.
When you have a lot of modules installed (eg: 500+)
this can lead to very big GET requests (more than 12k) which, in most of the cases,
will be blocked by the web server (eg: nginx) because they are too big.

This module tries to fix this by using modules' ids instead of names
reducing dramatically the size of such requests.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.
